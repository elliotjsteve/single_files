This is d-Day
I've decided that My Life is a Game
I'm gonna make myself happy(breezy)
Although I can set my own finish lines, I have to play by nature's rules
But I will not bow down.
I will bend and stretch the rules for my own fun and profit.
This is the loop:
set a finish line
find a problem
have revelations
get around the problem
be happy
